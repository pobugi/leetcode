# LeetCode Solutions

This repository is a work in progress as I continue to solve problems, improve solutions, and organize the content.

## About the Repository

This repository serves as a personal archive of my LeetCode problem solutions, organized for easy navigation and reference.

## Folder Structure (TODO)

Currently, the folder structure needs to be organized.
Each folder will contain subfolders or files categorized by problem names or LeetCode IDs for easy identification.

## Languages Used

I use the following programming languages for solving LeetCode problems:

- Python
- Golang
- TypeScript

## Current Progress

| Difficulty | Solved Problems |
|------------|-----------------|
| Easy       | 221             |
| Medium     | 105             |
| Hard       | 4               |

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:pobugi/leetcode.git
    cd leetcode
    ```
2. Navigate to the relevant category or folder to find a specific solution.
3. Open the solution file in your preferred editor to explore the code.

## Future Plans

- [ ] Organize solutions by difficulty and category.
- [ ] Add detailed comments explaining each solution.
- [ ] Include problem descriptions and test cases.
